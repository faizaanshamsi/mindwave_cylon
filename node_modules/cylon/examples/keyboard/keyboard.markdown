# Keyboard

For this Cylon example, we're going to quickly demonstrate getting keyboard
input.

First, let's import Cylon:

    var Cylon = require('../..');

With that done, let's define our robot:

    Cylon.robot({

It will have a single connection and device, both to the keyboard.

      connection: { name: 'keyboard', adaptor: 'keyboard' },
      device: { name: 'keyboard', driver: 'keyboard' },

When we tell this robot to work, it's going to listen to the 'a' key on the
keyboard and let us know when it's been pressed.

      work: function(my) {
        my.keyboard.on('a', function(key) { console.log("A PRESSED!") });
      }

With that done, let's get started!

    }).start();
