# Digispark Blink

First, let's import Cylon:

    var Cylon = require('../..');

Now that we have Cylon imported, we can start defining our robot

    Cylon.robot({

Let's define the connections and devices:

      connection: { name: 'digispark', adaptor: 'digispark' },

      device: { name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 1 },

Now that Cylon knows about the necessary hardware we're going to be using, we'll
tell it what work we want to do:

      work: function(my) {
        every((1).second(), my.led.toggle);
      }

Now that our robot knows what work to do, and the work it will be doing that
hardware with, we can start it:

    }).start();
